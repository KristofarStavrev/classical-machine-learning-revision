# Classical Machine Learning Revision

This repository is dedicated to revising and exploring classical machine learning models. It contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the implementation, intuition, and evaluation of foundational algorithms.

## Contents

The following notebooks are included:

- **Linear Regression and Regularization**: Covers basic linear regression and techniques like Ridge and Lasso regularization.
- **Logistic Regression**: Focuses on logistic regression for classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: Demonstrates decision tree algorithms for both regression and classification.
- **Random Forest**: Explores ensemble learning with random forests.
- **Tree Boosting**: Introduces boosting methods such as GBM, AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KristofarStavrev/classical-machine-learning-revision.git
   cd classical-machine-learning-revision
   ```
2. Install dependencies (recommended: use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)):
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   poetry run jupyter lab
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- JupyterLab
- numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, xgboost, lightgbm, catboost

All dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml` and will be installed with Poetry.
